# riscv-emulator
Emulator which aims to include functionality for RV32I, the base ISA of RISC-V.

## Resources:
Below are a list of resources I've found to be helful when developing this project.

*The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas* by Patterson & Waterman.

*The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual* by Waterman & Asanovic.

*Modern Computer Architecture and Organization* by Ledin. I recommend this to those who want a broad, rather than deep, overview of topics surrounding computer architecture and embedded systems. It contains great exercises and explanations and is written in such a way to not take too much of a busy professional's or self-learner's time. (Given an review copy of this book by Packt, so a big thank you to them for providing such an excellent reference!)
